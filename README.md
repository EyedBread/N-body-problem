# N-problem-project

To compile: For the N^2 version, go into the Naive folder and run make to compile program 1 and program 2. For the Barnes-Hut version, go into either Serial/Parallel directory, and run ```make``` which should create a ```BarnesHut``` executable. Then input the arguments as stated in the assignment.

An extra argument flag has been added to the end for the BarnesHut programs, ```-gui``` which will start the graphical interface to visualise the output.
